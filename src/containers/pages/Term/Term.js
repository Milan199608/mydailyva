The Client agrees that if the Client breaches this section 6, the Contractor will incur substantial economic damages and losses in amounts which are impossible to compute and ascertain with certainty as a basis for recovery by the Contractor of actual damages, and that liquidated damages represent a fair, reasonable and appropriate estimate thereof. Accordingly, in lieu of actual damages for such breach, the Client agrees that liquidated damages may be assessed and recovered by the Contractor as against the Client in the event of such breach and without the Contractor being required to present any evidence of the amount or character of actual damages sustained by reason thereof; therefore the Client shall be liable to the Contractor for payment of liquidated damages in the amount of US$10,000.00 with respect to any of the Contractor’s staff that the Client solicits, recruits, induces, attempts to recruit or induce, or encourages to leave the Contractor in order to provide services directly to the Client. Such liquidated damages represent estimated actual damages to the Contractor arising from having to replace the VAs or other staff so recruited, and are not intended as a penalty. The Client shall pay the liquidated damages to the Contractor within five (5) days of notice from the Contractor of the resignation of a VA or other staff and whether or not the Contractor has exercised its right to terminate the Term.
